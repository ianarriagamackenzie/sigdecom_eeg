# Signal Decomposition (FFT) of EEG Data

**Method_RExample.R**: Example of signal decomposition on a mixed signal with added random noise. Showcases how applying a Fast Fourier Transform will allow us to estimate the original frequencies of the mixed signal.

**MMJ_SleepStudy**: Example code for applying signal decomposition analysis to electroencephalogram data to estimate differences in brain states between two groups of subjects.
